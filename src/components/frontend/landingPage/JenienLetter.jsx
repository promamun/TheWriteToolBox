                  <p>
                    Before I became a published author, I had all the same
                    thoughts I’m sure you have or have had about writing a book.
                    I doubted I could do it. I had no clue how to format a book.
                    I knew nothing about even self-publishing a book. All of my
                    experience came from a corporate career as a legal
                    assistant. What I did know was that writing is where I
                    flourished on the job. Through my life experiences, I also
                    knew that words matter. Words are energy and power and can
                    evoke love or hate, healing or hurt, safety or harm,
                    humiliation or humility. You see, the words we choose,
                    either in anger or love, truly develop a person’s beliefs
                    and personality. With each and every word we choose, us
                    humans either drive connectivity or construct dissention.
                    What I’ve come to understand is that humans were not created
                    to be on opposing sides. We were created to thrive off one
                    another, cultivate relationships, and live abundantly
                    together. We were created to flourish with one another, be
                    supportive, and help each other. We were created to be
                    different, diverse – that alone is amazing. What I am most
                    passionate about now is helping others communicate
                    charismatically by choosing words that illicit connection
                    and belonging. It would be my pleasure and honor to help you
                    explode your expression, become a published author, and
                    attract those that were created to be in your tribe.
